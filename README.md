# lipidiipikar
Lipidiipikar is the first telegraph code for Burmese (Myanmar language), invented by Yaw Min Gyi U Pho Hlaing in 1869. I have developed a software simulation of this encoding based on two books: Lipidiipikar, written by Yaw Min Gyi U Pho Hlaing in 1869, and Myanmar Scientists of the Konbaung Period, written by Dr. Myo Thant Tin in 1984.
